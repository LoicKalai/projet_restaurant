# Project Restaurant
The goal of this project was to create a web site for a restaurant that we created.  We had to create a design of our web-site in figma. Because we took as a main theme of the restaurant dishes of the world, we choose the name Sabor del Mundo, which means savors of the world.

## Context 

We started the 10th of March 2022, and it lasted for at least 3 weeks. We were 3 to work on this project, so we had to divide our tasks and concentrate on our own parts in order to not waste our time. This is one of the most important projects during our studies for Onlineformapro, because this is the first big project which includes not only creating the visual part (front-end) but also it should be fully functional thanks to back part(back-end). Initially we started to design the web-site from scratch but then we realized that it might take too much time to do it, so we took a template in order to save some time.
